# Cousera-TensorFlow-in-Practice-Specialization

This is the specialization course for learning Teansorflow and understand how to use its functions and modules to implement ML and DL projects. There are four courses included in it which are listed below in the form of sub-headings. Here, I will update the week wise assignments done during the learning process of each courses.
